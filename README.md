# SQL-Interview-Questions
 A collection of sql questions ranging from easy to hard difficulty asked across several companies. The 'Query Problems' folder contains the questions and the schema for the dataset while the 'Query Solutions' folder consists of the solutions to the problems. Try solving problems on your own, which gives you the freedom to shape your own unique solution which might even be better than the solution given! MySQL was used to solve the questions (You might see USE PRACTICE at some instances which you can discard in your tool, it was just the database name I used to solve questions)
